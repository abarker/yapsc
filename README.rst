yapsc -- Yet Another Python Switch-Case
=======================================

Another Python implementation of a switch-case statement.  Many versions and
variations of Python switch-case constructs are out there, but this one has
syntax and a combination of features I have not seen.  (The closest to this
version is probably at `tetrapus/switchcase
<https://github.com/tetrapus/switchcase>`_.)

This is basically just convenient syntax for defining a dict-based function
dispatch.  The switch call is quite efficient, and can be separated from the
switch definition and its associated overhead.  Fallthrough is not implemented,
but the `case` decorator can take multiple arguments to match (like Pascal's
case statement rather than C's).

Example code
------------

.. code-block:: python

   from yapsc import Switch, case, default

   class CommandSwitch(Switch):

       @case("play")
       def _():
           print("play command")

       @case("back")
       def _():
           print("back command")

       @case("forward")
       def _():
           print("forward command")

       @case("back", "forward")
       def _():
           print("back or forward command")

       @default
       def _():
           print("default case")

   command = "back"
   CommandSwitch(command)

This prints out::

   back command
   back or forward command

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install yapsc

Usage notes
-----------

* Any (and only) hashable values can be switched on.

* When there are multiple matching cases their function are called in the
  sequence that they were defined in.

* The class name can be arbitrary, but should be different from any other
  switches in the same scope.
  
* The case-function names are ignored and can either be `"_"` or any valid
  attribute name not starting with `"_"`, excepting `"switch"`.  Case functions
  are set as staticmethods of the class and can also be called that way
  (assuming they have a unique function name).

* The switch can be called 1) as a function call to the user-defined switch
  class, 2) via the `switch` classmethod of the user-defined switch class,
  or 3) by passing the control variable as the `on` keyword argument to the
  switch class definition.

* Calls to the switch return a tuple of all the return values of all the
  case-functions that were run.  (But note that running from the `on` keyword
  in the switch definition does not return a value.)

* The switch class should be defined in the scope you want to be visible to
  the case-function code.

* If possible don't define the switch class inside a loop; just put the call
  inside the loop.  Then in the loop you get real dict-hashed function
  dispatch without the definition overhead.

* If the case-functions take parameters and/or keyword arguments they must
  all take the same number of parameters and same keywords.  The parameter
  values must be passed as extra arguments in the call to the switch.  The
  `on` keyword cannot be used in this case.

It should be noted that if Python's `PEP-622
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/>`_ for pattern matching is accepted
then for future Python versions these kinds of switch-case implementations may
become outdated.
